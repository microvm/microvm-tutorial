Mu Tutorial
===========

This tutorial is about the `Mu micro virtual machine <http://microvm.org/>`__.

A micro VM is a minimalist virtual machine as an underlying substrate for
high-level programming language implementations. Mu is designed for languages
that are concurrent, JIT compiled and use garbage collection.

Language Implementor's Tutorial
===============================

This part is suitable for those who wish to implement a programming language on
top of Mu.
